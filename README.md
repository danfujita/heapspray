# Heapspray
My talk for DC Hack and Tell (Round 33: NULL adhesive heresy) on Tue Jun 7.

This project describes how to create an additional administrator in order to attack a victim system.  I wrote my own version of shellcode for the Windows XP operation system and used it to exploit by using a technique called heap spray using the tutorial from Corelan.be.  It is a straightforward method and can be implemented in few days.
